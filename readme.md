A collectively-created website collaboratively created by the Self-Taught Tech Network (STTN) community.

## :question: What is this?

Many self-taught developers learn to code by themselves by reading or watching tutorials and coding along with them. Eventually they will probably strike out and create a few projects.

Many jobs are performed in a team setting with many developers may be working on the same code. To get this experience outside of a job, open-source projects are the way to go. However, it can be intimidating to get involved with these projects because they are broad and complicated and often difficult to know what you could contribute.

It is also difficult to know *how* you could contribute. How do I get my code into someone else's project?

So that's the purpose of [STaTioN](https://station-team.netlify.app). It's a website. The main page is the `index.html` file in the root of this repository. It imports a `stylesheet` and a `javascript` file.

Here is what you can contribute to this project:

- anything.

Seriously! You can add a link to another website/project you're working on. Make the links pink. Flip a div upside-down. Add to this `readme` file! Stuck? Have a look at the `issues` tab and see if anything jumps out at you.

**You are encouraged to get involved, make mistakes, and break things.**

We're all learning here and like many things in the coding world, you learn best by *doing*. So do!



## :hammer: Getting Started

There can be a lot to learn when getting involved in open-source projects if you've never done it before. If you already know some HTML, you should be able to get started here by learning a little bit about Git and Github. Git is version control software, if you do a web search you should find a lot of resources to get you started.

Do you already know about these things? One of your contributors found [this handy guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-start-opensource-contributions/) to get you started with forking a repository and creating a pull request. Our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jeffreycharters/station/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) has some quick steps that could also get you started. If you are comfortable reading documentation, Github's is pretty accessible and they have a good section on [working collaboratively](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) that is worth a read.
