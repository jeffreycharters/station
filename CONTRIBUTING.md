# Contributing to STaTioN

The entire purpose of this repository/website combination is to learn and have fun.

We think it's super if you're interested in contributing and will accept a lot of changes as long as people are trying.

Here are some guidelines to make sure things stay educational and positive:

- Don't be mean. We're all people and the world can be negative enough already.
- Try to make a meaningful contribution. It can be small and pretty inconsequential, but will preferably have some thought behind it. Spammy/nonsense contributions will be rejected. If you are worried your contribution might fit this description, it's probably fine. Get in touch with us on the [STTN Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NhAfhBnh8g) or open/comment on an issue if you have any concerns.

The main focus is to learn to use Git/hub while collaborating with others as an entry into the world of open source software.

Having said all that, we're excited to see what you have to contribute to our little website!
