# :hammer: Prerequisite skills 
In order to contribute to this project, all you need is:

- The zeal to learn

# :tada: How to contribute
1. Before you can work on this, you need to `fork` the project. A fork is a copy of a repository. The fork button is shown below.
![Screenshot of repo page with fork button circled.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81039882/193431398-75d3d606-8e6e-42ea-b153-3b6dfbf59742.png)


 2. In order to work on this project in your local IDE, you have to clone your fork.

    - Open your terminal. Create an empty directory on your computer `mkdir <the directory name>`
    - Use `cd <the directory name>` to navigate into the folder.
    - Copy the link to your forked project from the browser and run `git clone <the link to your clone>`
    - `cd station` to navigate into the project directory.

3. Your local repository is not in sync with the remote, so whenever you need to work locally, it is important to make sure that your local repo is up to date with the remote. For this, run.
`git fetch upstream` and then
`git merge upstream/main`

4. Make your changes to the code :smile:

5. Stage your changes. Run `git add <the path to the file you made changes to>`

6. Commit your changes.
`git commit -m "<your commit message>"`

7. Time for a push! `git push -u origin main`

8. Go back to your remote repo (your fork). Click on the pull request tab, and open a pull request for your new changes :tada:

:bomb: A maintainer will review your changes and merge. This will officially add your changes to the original repository.

> **Note** This is an open project for practice purposes. Contributions that you make may or may not get overriden by changes from other contributors. Our purpose is to get people comfortable with open source, and that is why there are no rules as to what someone can add.

# :bulb: Issues
This is where discussions happen. If you find something odd on the site, or just want to start a discussion for a new feature, feel free to create an issue. Get assigned and fix it, or someone else could fix it.

:heart: **Wow us with your contributions now!**
